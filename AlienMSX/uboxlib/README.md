# ubox MSX lib

This is a set of libraries and tools to make MSX games using the C programming
language.

There are three main components:

  - **ubox**: thin wrapper around MSX 1 BIOS, focusing on Screen 2 and 32K
    cartridge ROMs.
  - **spman**: a simple sprite and pattern manager with flickering support.
  - **mplayer**: a wrapper around Arkos 2 AKM player, supporting music and
    priority based one channel sound effects.

The aim is making MSX games in C, without writing Z80 assembler or having a
deep knowledge of the system.

## Requirements

 - SDCC (3.9.0 recommended)
 - GNU Make (others may work)
 - a POSIX compatible environment

If you want to build the example you will also need:

 - python 3
 - pillow
 - GCC (only the C compiler)
 - Disark, one of the tools distributed with Arkos Tracker 2 (download from
   [Arkos Tracker 2 website](http://www.julien-nevo.com/arkostracker/))

On Windows 10, there are reports of successful builds using:

 - latest version of Cygwin64 with package for gcc-core 10.2.0-1
 - SDCC 4.0.0
 - python 3.9.1

If you want to build the docs you will also need:

 - pandoc
 - python 3
 - pygments
 - pandocfilters

## Building

To build the libraries run:

    make

After a successful build, the libraries should be in `./lib`.

The include files are ready to use in `./include`.

Add those directories in `SDCC`'s search path and you are ready to go.

### Building the example

An example game is included with the libraries and it can be built with:

    make game

After a successful build, the game ROM should be in `./bin`.

### Building the docs

The documentation is available at
[usebox.net](https://www.usebox.net/jjm/ubox-msx-lib/), so this is optional.

To build the docs run:

    make docs

The reference in `HTML` format will be generated in `./docs`.
