# GREEN

This is a example game to demo and test functionality of ubox MSX lib.

It has only one screen, is not too exciting!

In the menu press fire on any joystick or space to play with cursors (space as
fire).

Use fire to activate the elevators and ESC to exit the game.

This game is meant to be a demo, and because of that, it is simple and not
specially optimised; but you can see that it moves the player and 7 enemies
just fine and **it is a good example on how to write a game in C for the MSX**.
